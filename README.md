# netflix_clone

This is a project for TrueCoders.io designed to reinforce HTML and CSS basics by using the Chrome Developer Tools to inspect HTML and CSS and clone the styling of a website. 

I chose to create a clone of the netflix splash page using HTML and Tailwind CSS. It is not a perfect clone since I used Tailwind's base styles rather than creating a CSS file within the project's directory.
